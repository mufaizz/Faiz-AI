# FAIZ-AI — Search Bot

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/mufaizz/FAIZ-AI/blob/main/LICENSE)

FAIZ-AI is an asynchronous CLI tool for searching and retrieving files across multiple protocols (HTTP, FTP, IPFS, Torrent) in parallel. It combines semantic search with vector embeddings to rank candidate results.

License: MIT — see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for full terms.

🚀 Key capabilities:
- Multi-protocol simultaneous search (HTTP, FTP, IPFS, Torrent)
- Semantic ranking using SentenceTransformer embeddings
- Asynchronous, non-blocking architecture (asyncio + aiohttp)
- Built-in safety measures: spell correction, intent verification, extension blocking
- CLI-first design for automation and scripting

## Highlights
- Multi-protocol aggregator: query HTTP (including Google dorking for file types), public FTP servers, IPFS gateways, and Torrent DHT-like discovery simultaneously.
- Semantic intelligence: uses `sentence-transformers` (default model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to embed queries and candidate results, ranking by semantic similarity rather than raw keyword matches.
- Asynchronous design with connection pools, rate-limiting and timeouts to support concurrent operations.
- Safety-focused: includes basic safeguards such as spell correction, intent filtering and extension blocking; these do not guarantee safety and should not be considered a replacement for careful review.

---

## Features
- Multi-Protocol Search
  - HTTP: targeted searching (file types, dorks)
  - FTP: asynchronous scanning of public FTP servers (e.g., FreeBSD mirrors, kernel.org)
  - IPFS: search via public IPFS gateways
  - Torrent: DHT-style discovery for magnets and .torrent metadata
- Semantic Ranking
  - Embeddings via `sentence-transformers` (configurable model)
- Smart Query Processing
  - Spell correction (pyspellchecker)
  - Intent verification to block malicious or unsafe queries
- Safety Verifiers
  - Extension filtering (recommend blocking dangerous extensions like `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`)
- Output
  - Real-time logs during scanning
  - Final ranked results saved to `faiz_results.json`

## Install

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Linux/Unix environment recommended for automated script

### Automated setup
The repository includes a setup script that will install system packages, create a virtual environment, and install dependencies.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

> The script may run system package updates. Review the script before running if you prefer manual control.

### Manual setup
Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mufaizz/FAIZ-AI.git
cd FAIZ-AI
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

---

## Configuration

All runtime configuration lives in `config/config.yaml`. Example configuration (trimmed):

```yaml
core:
  model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"    # SentenceTransformer model
  timeout: 60                  # global search timeout in seconds

protocols:
  active: ["http", "ftp", "ipfs", "torrent"]

filetypes:
  http: ["pdf", "docx", "txt", "mp4", "iso"]

safety:
  blocked_extensions: [".exe", ".bat", ".sh"]

ftp:
  public_servers:
    - "ftp.freebsd.org"
    - "ftp.kernel.org"
```

Adjust `config/config.yaml` to enable/disable protocols, change the model, or set safety policies.

---

## Usage

Activate the virtual environment (if not already active):

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Run the CLI:

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter a query at the prompt, for example:
- `linux documentation pdf`
- `ubuntu iso torrent`

What happens:
- FAIZ-AI performs parallel searches across configured protocols.
- Candidates are embedded and ranked by semantic similarity to your query.
- Top results are printed and saved to `faiz_results.json`.

## Safety & legal

FAIZ-AI is provided as an educational/personal project. Use responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws.

- Do not use FAIZ-AI to retrieve copyrighted material unless you have permission.
- The tool includes filters and safeguards, but protection is not guaranteed — review and verify results as appropriate.
- The project does not provide guarantees about the safety or legality of retrieved files.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (e.g., `feat/ipfs-improvements`).
3. Add tests where applicable.
4. Open a pull request describing the change.

Please keep changes focused and well-documented. If you want help drafting issues or breaking large features into tasks, open an issue describing your idea.
